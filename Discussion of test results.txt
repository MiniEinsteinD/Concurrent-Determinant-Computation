Some test results:

The original matrix: 

    shared_stuff->M[0][0]= 20;
    shared_stuff->M[0][1]= 20;
    shared_stuff->M[0][2]= 50;

    shared_stuff->M[1][0]= 10;
    shared_stuff->M[1][1]= 6;
    shared_stuff->M[1][2]= 70;

    shared_stuff->M[2][0]= 40;
    shared_stuff->M[2][1]= 3;
    shared_stuff->M[2][2]= 2;

The final output: (you may find the detailed output in the README.txt file)

    The det value of the matrix M [R] = 41140
    The largest value of the matrix M [L] = 70

Discussion: 

    By comparing the resulting answer using the code I developed and the answer obtained from the calculator, 
    I achieve the exact same results which implies that my code functions correctly.

The matrix: 

    shared_stuff->M[0][0]= 6;
    shared_stuff->M[0][1]= 1;
    shared_stuff->M[0][2]= 1;

    shared_stuff->M[1][0]= 4;
    shared_stuff->M[1][1]= -2;
    shared_stuff->M[1][2]= 5;

    shared_stuff->M[2][0]= 2;
    shared_stuff->M[2][1]= 8;
    shared_stuff->M[2][2]= 7;

The final output: 

    The det value of the matrix M [R] = -306
    The largest value of the matrix M [L] = 8
